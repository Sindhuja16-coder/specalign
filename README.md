# 🚀 SpecAlign: The Logic Auditor

**Bridge the gap between project requirements and implementation.**

Built for **"The UI Strikes Back"** hackathon hosted by **WeMakeDevs**.

---

## 📖 The Origin Story

> "A while ago, I submitted a pull request to a repository. I was confident, but it was closed immediately because I missed a single requirement. That rejection taught me that code isn't just about syntax; it's about following the requirements. So, I built SpecAlign."

## ⚖️ Why SpecAlign?

While traditional tools focus on **how** the code is written, SpecAlign focuses on **what** the code is doing.

- **Standard Linters (ESLint/Prettier):** Catch **Syntax Errors** and enforce **Code Style**, but stay blind to project rules.
- **Unit Tests (Jest/Vitest):** Verify **Functional Logic**, but can't tell if you used the wrong architecture.
- **SpecAlign:** Engineered to bridge the gap by catching:
  - **Project Spec Compliance:** Ensuring every "must-have" requirement is met.
  - **Contextual Logic Gaps:** Identifying high-level mismatches between code and project goals.

## 🛠️ How It Works (Powered by Tambo & Charlie)

SpecAlign leverages a high-performance stack to automate logic auditing:

1. **Requirement Analysis:** The tool parses project specifications and lists them on a **Tambo-powered interactive dashboard**.
2. **Violation Flagging:** Powered by **Charlie**, our autonomous TypeScript engineer, SpecAlign scans the repo to highlight deviations from project rules.
3. **Generative UI Alignment:** Utilizing **Tambo’s React SDK**, we provide generative, interactable components that allow users to "Apply Fix" and refactor code instantly to match the spec.

## 🏗️ Built With

- **[Tambo](https://tambo.io):** Driving the Generative UI, interactable components, and MCP integrations.
- **[Charlie](https://charlie.ai):** Our autonomous TypeScript engineer handling the core logic auditing engine.
- **React & TypeScript:** For a robust, type-safe developer experience.
